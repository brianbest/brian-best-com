## 🔧 Configuration Notes

### Sanity CMS
The site includes mock data fallbacks for when Sanity CMS is not configured. To enable Sanity:

1. Set environment variables:
   ```env
   SANITY_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
   SANITY_DATASET=production
   SANITY_API_VERSION=2023-10-21
   ```

2. The site will automatically use Sanity data when configured, or fall back to mock data

### Environment Variables
Required for production (optional for static build):
- `SANITY_PROJECT_ID` - Sanity project ID (uses placeholder if not set)
- `SANITY_DATASET` - Sanity dataset name (defaults to "production")
- `SANITY_API_VERSION` - Sanity API version (defaults to "2023-10-21")

### Dependencies
Install with:
```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

Note: Using `--legacy-peer-deps` due to date-fns peer dependency conflict.

## 📊 Performance

Expected Lighthouse scores:
- **Performance:** 90+ (static pages, optimized images)
- **Accessibility:** 95+ (semantic HTML, ARIA labels)
- **Best Practices:** 90+
- **SEO:** 100 (proper meta tags, sitemap)

## 🎨 Visual Features

Implemented:
- ✅ Pixel borders (3px solid)
- ✅ Chunky pixel shadows
- ✅ Blinking status indicators
- ✅ Progress bars with pixel styling
- ✅ Corner decorations on images
- ✅ Hover effects with transforms

- **4 projects:** AI Code Review, Blog Redesign, Dashboard, Collaboration Tool
- **Now page:** Current focus, learning goals, reading list, side projects
- **Uses page:** Hardware, software, VS Code extensions, workflow

### To Update Content
1. **With Sanity:** Configure Sanity CMS and create content
2. **Without Sanity:** Edit mock data in:
   - `lib/posts.ts` - Update mockPosts array
   - `lib/projects.ts` - Update mockProjects array
   - `app/now/page.tsx` - Update data directly in component
   - `app/uses/page.tsx` - Update data directly in component
